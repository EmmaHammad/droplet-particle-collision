Three noteworthy points:

In the world governed by data, but with so many scenarios in which physical acquisition is costly, numerical simulation can represent a promising path for the development of statistical models.

It is important to consider the deterministic nature of numerical models, and to incorporate the physical distribution of the variables studied for the correct computational experiment planning.

Understanding the phenomenon involved and physical modeling are very important for the reliability of statistical conclusions, and help to understand the accumulation of error that occurs in all phases of the process of creating a predictive model.
