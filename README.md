# droplet-particle-collision
Under construction... A series of droplet-particle impact simulation scenarios based on basilisk.fr CFD framework. It includes: 1. Three-phase flow modeling; 2. Evaporation case in the gavaises-2016b directory; 3. Design of Computer Experiment and Statistical Learning Methods Applied to model liquid film interfacial area, amirfazli-2017 case.
